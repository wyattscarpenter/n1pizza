This is a theme for a very specific type of tumblr power user. For this tumblr theme, I thought "web design is a curse upon the world of the living; what if I only included the bare minimum of html in order to get all the possible functionality of a tumblr blog" and the answer is you get a sick theme!

Notable:

* theme source is roughly 100 lines (short!)

* generated html is about 20KB (small!)

  * I can't guarantee that these metric are correct, but, for reference, the official tumblr theme is about 100KB (as are most themes?) and popular minimalist theme Observer, which I previously used, is about 40KB. Tumblr's "default mobile theme" that happens when you visit a blog on a phone and the blog owner hasn't opted out of this options, seems to be 200KB, for some reason? That's weird. tumblr's /mobile option is about 20KB, but due to its lack of borders it's pretty much unusable (illegible).

* has no javascript or css in it, therefore it is quick and efficient. I think in generating the page from the theme tumblr adds some javascript in... sorry, nothing I can do.

* because of the above two and half points, this theme should be a breeze and a joy to use, and be faster than most other themes. How much faster? Hard to say. I did not measure.

* despite this, N1 Pizza has functionality often neglected by other themes, such as: page count and page total, clearly indicating submissions, and putting all the goddamn stuff under the post (where possible)

* N1 Pizza always loads the highest-quality media (images, videos) because I don't like having to futz around with that stuff, personally. This does slow load times a bit, presumably. Especially because the theme is likely to be cached by your computer while the images aren't, so they're what really matter, presumably. I thought this was a good tradeoff because if I get a smaller image more often than not I have to click on it to see a bigger version anyway, in which case we've triggered another pageload AND loaded the original image, so any advantage of that method is lost.

* I did not particularly try to facilitate group blogs with this theme, because I have no experience with them. If you run a group blog, and you think something you need is missing from this theme, drop me a line!

* Despite tumblr's goading, I did not try to facilitate any sort of customizations options into this theme. Please use the "custom css" option (which I did enable) or edit the html directly. In fact, I release this project into the public domain so that you may do with your modified copies what you wish!

* tumblr insists I upload all screenshots as strictly 630x450, as though that were a screen resolution anyone uses, so I've only provided them one due to the amount of hassle. Also, the thumbnail is required to be precisely 375x250, as though that was thumbnail size. Weird.
